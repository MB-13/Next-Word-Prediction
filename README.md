# Next-Word-Prediction
This model predicts next few words of a sentence just like in Gmail compose section, when we write a mail it suggests next few words.
<br>
It uses Bidirectional LSTM layers.
<br>
With more data it could be made more perfect but due to lack of resources to compute that much amount of data we have used a small dataset.
<br>
Using optuna we can also find best parameters for model but for same reason I have not used it. Although I have provided a medthod how you can do it.
